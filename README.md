## Challenges 
Once Sequelize was installed - I executed "NPX Sequelize init" as instructed at the end of class - my code kept returning errors within the index.js file that Sequelize imported into my /models folder. I found that very frustrating after trying to add in Sequelize. I got all of my model files created and looking good - but everytime I went to test the CLI and inquirer portion - the sequelize files crashed the application.
